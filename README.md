# CuprumPDF

## Description

CuprumPDF is a PDF viewer based on [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), which is currently the only PDF renderer written in a memory-safe language. It doesn't require any permission: the PDF to be visualized is passed to the app using [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html).

This is a fork  of [PDF Viewer](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_packages_apps_PdfViewer) from CopperheadOS made before the license [was changed](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_packages_apps_PdfViewer/commit/158fe6c80a4e83334d7ea6d24c689709855d9963) from Apache 2.0 to Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike, which is not a Free/Libre Software license due to the NonCommercial clause. The credit for the idea and implementation goes to the original author.

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome. Please don't submit feature requests if you're not willing to contribute with code; I'm not an Android developer, so I won't implement them. Do not rip off non-free code from Copperhead's repository. The licenses are not compatible, so new features have to be written from scratch.
