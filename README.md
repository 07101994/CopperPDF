# CuprumPDF

## Description

CuprumPDF is a PDF viewer based on [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). It doesn't require any permission: the PDF to be visualized is passed to the app using [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html).

This is a fork  of [PDF Viewer](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_packages_apps_PdfViewer) from CopperheadOS made before the license [was changed](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_packages_apps_PdfViewer/commit/158fe6c80a4e83334d7ea6d24c689709855d9963) from Apache 2.0 to Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike, which is not a Free/Libre Software license due to the NonCommercial clause.

## Technical Overview

Since JavaScript is memory safe, memory safety bugs in the PDF implementation itself are not a concern and the performance is still tolerable. The app exposes a very small subset of the Chromium attack surface and the WebView sandbox acts as an additional layer of isolation thatâ€™s significantly stronger than the usual app sandbox. It renders via a 2D canvas and loads fonts via the FontFace API using the hardened Chromium font rendering stack (font sanitization, etc.).

The app uses Content Security Policy (CSP) to permit only static content from the app assets, connections to content: URIs and image `blob:` data. The policy prevents dynamic and inline JS/CSS and provides some attack surface reduction for the DOM. JS API attack surface is limited indirectly due to the code being static. File access and network access are also disabled for the WebView, so other than `content:` URIs provided to the app it can only access apk assets and resources.

The pdf.js solution is also nearly ideal when the source of the PDFs is Chromium or a Chromium-based browser due to presenting only a small subset of the same attack surface.

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome. Please don't submit feature requests if you're not willing to contribute with code; I'm not an Android developer, so I won't implement them. Do not rip off non-free code from Copperhead's repository: this fork is about freedom, not about features.
